### **Function and Activities**
The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) of RegulonDB plays a central role in ensuring the scientific quality, strategic direction, and community alignment of the resource. The board includes members from diverse institutions from Mexico, USA and Europe, offering broad geographic and disciplinary representation.

**Function:**

-   To provide expert guidance on scientific priorities, technical developments, and conceptual frameworks.
-   To ensure that RegulonDB continues to address current and emerging needs of the microbial regulation research community.   
-   To contribute to long-term visioning, including international positioning and sustainability strategies.
    

**Activities:**

-   The SAB convenes at least twice a year in structured meetings to: 
    -   Review progress since the previous meeting.       
    -   Evaluate scientific objectives and their implementation.       
    -   Advise on opportunities for funding and strategic collaborations.       
    -   Discuss mechanisms for community engagement and responsiveness.       
-   Members may also be consulted on an _ad hoc basis_, depending on their specific area of expertise, particularly when novel challenges or opportunities arise.
