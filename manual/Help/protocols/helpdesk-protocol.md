# User Support Protocol - RegulonDB Helpdesk

## 1. Objective
Establish the procedure for handling and following up on questions, doubts, or technical issues sent to the official RegulonDB support email: **regulondb@ccg.unam.mx**.

## 2. Scope
This protocol applies to all members of the RegulonDB team involved in user support: curators, technical staff, and the software project lead.

## 3. Support Channel
- Email address: **regulondb@ccg.unam.mx**
- This is a **shared distribution list** that includes:
  - Resource curators
  - Technical development team
  - Software project leader

## 4. Procedure
### 4.1 Receiving messages
- All list members receive the incoming message.
- The content of the message must be reviewed as soon as possible (ideally within the same business day).

### 4.2 Message classification
- If the message contains a **scientific or curation-related query**:
  - It is assigned to **one of the curators**.
- If it is a **technical issue** (site error, functionality, visualization, API, etc.):
  - The software project lead assesses the likely cause.
  - The issue is redirected to the appropriate developer or handled internally.

### 4.3 User response
- The assigned person must draft a clear and complete reply.
- **All responses must be sent with a copy to the mailing list**, so that the entire team stays informed.

### 4.4 Follow-up
- If more time or technical information is needed, an acknowledgment should be sent to the user indicating that their request is in progress.
- Follow-up continues until the issue is resolved.
- Optionally, the case may be logged in a ticketing or internal tracking system.

## 5. Best practices
- Avoid sending individual replies that exclude the team.
- Use clear, professional, and courteous language.
- Invite users to follow up if they need further assistance.
- Consider recording frequent questions as the basis for a future FAQ section.

## 6. Contact and continuous improvement
This protocol may be updated as the support system evolves. Suggestions and improvements should be sent to the software project lead.
