Access to this Website may involve the use of cookies. Cookies are small amounts of information stored in the browser used by each User—in the various devices they may use to browse—so that the server remembers certain information that the server that implemented it will read later and only. Cookies make navigation easier, more user-friendly, and do not harm the browsing device.

Cookies are automatic procedures for collecting information about the preferences determined by the User during their visit to the Website in order to recognize them as a User and personalize their experience and use of the Website. They can also, for example, help identify and resolve errors.

The information collected through cookies may include the date and time of visits to the Website, the pages viewed, the time spent on the Website, and the sites visited just before and after it. However, no cookie allows this same information to be contacted with the User's phone number or any other personal contact method. No cookie can extract information from the User's hard drive or steal personal information. The only way for the User's private information to become part of the Cookie file is for the user to personally provide that information to the server.

Cookies that allow a person to be identified are considered personal data. Therefore, the Privacy Policy described above will apply to them. In this regard, the User's consent will be required for their use. This consent will be communicated, based on a genuine choice, offered by means of an affirmative and positive decision, before the initial treatment, removable and documented.

Own Cookies
These are cookies that are sent to the User's computer or device and exclusively managed by RegulonDB Escherichia coli K-12 Transcriptional Regulatory Network for the proper functioning of the Website. The information collected is used to improve the quality of the Website and its Content and the User's experience. These cookies allow recognizing the User as a recurring visitor to the Website and adapting the content to offer them content that matches their preferences.

## Third-Party Cookies

These are cookies used and managed by external entities that provide services requested by RegulonDB Escherichia coli K-12 Transcriptional Regulatory Network to improve the Website and the user's experience when browsing the Website. The main objectives for which third-party cookies are used are to obtain access statistics and analyze browsing information, that is, how the User interacts with the Website.

The information obtained refers, for example, to the number of pages visited, the language, the place from which the User's IP address accesses, the number of Users who access, the frequency and recurrence of visits, the time of the visit, the browser they use, the operator or type of device from which the visit is made. This information is used to improve the Website and identify new needs to offer Users content and/or a service of the highest quality. In any case, the information is collected anonymously, and trend reports of the Website are prepared without identifying individual users.
