# RegulonDB – Ethical Use and Data Responsibility Statement

**Version 1.0 – April 2025**

## 1. Overview

RegulonDB is a curated knowledge base focused on the transcriptional regulation of *Escherichia coli* and related bacterial species. Although we do not manage sensitive human data or geolocation data of endangered species, we are committed to **ethical data stewardship**, **transparency**, and **responsible reuse** of scientific information.

## 2. Data Sources and Responsibility

- All data integrated into RegulonDB is obtained from **peer-reviewed scientific publications**.
- Each annotated object (e.g., promoter, transcription factor, regulatory interaction) is **linked to the original source**, allowing traceability and verification.
- We respect the **ethical approvals and consent procedures** of the original research; we do not include data from unpublished, proprietary, or unethically obtained studies.

## 3. FAIR Principles and Open Science

We support the **FAIR guiding principles**:

- **Findability** through persistent identifiers,
- **Accessibility** via open APIs and downloads,
- **Interoperability** via standard formats (e.g., JSON, GFF),
- **Reusability** via clear licensing and metadata.

We encourage **data reuse for scientific and educational purposes**, while maintaining clear provenance and citation guidelines.

## 4. Human and Sensitive Data

RegulonDB does **not include human genomic data, clinical information**, or personal identifiers. If in the future we integrate data with ethical sensitivities (e.g., microbiome-host interactions, environmental geolocation), we will adopt appropriate controls and review mechanisms aligned with **GDPR, COPE, and scientific community guidelines**.

## 5. Contributions and Curation Practices

- All internal and external contributions to RegulonDB undergo **expert curation** and documentation review.
- Contributors are expected to comply with **ethical research practices** and ensure that data derived from experimental work has the necessary approvals.

## 6. Responsible Use

We ask users of RegulonDB to:
- Use data responsibly and in accordance with scientific integrity.
- Cite the database and original publications appropriately.
- Report any ethical concerns or misuse via our contact page.

## 7. Governance and Continuous Improvement

This policy is maintained by the RegulonDB governance team and will be reviewed annually. We welcome feedback from the community to improve our ethical standards and practices.

## 8. Website Analytics and User Tracking

We use **Google Analytics** to monitor traffic, usage patterns, and user engagement with the RegulonDB website. These data help us improve the resource and prioritize features. The information collected is anonymized and aggregated; we do not collect personal identifiers.

By using this site, users consent to this type of data collection. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking using [this browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

All data collected via analytics are used **exclusively for internal evaluation and improvement** of RegulonDB and are **not shared with third parties**.

This information helps us:

- Track the reach and application of RegulonDB in research and education.
- Prioritize improvements based on use cases.
- Demonstrate value to funders and supporting institutions.

All data collected through the download form is used **exclusively for internal purposes**. It will not be sold, shared, or used for marketing. Submission of this form is a condition for data download, but users may opt out of communications.

We appreciate your collaboration in helping us sustain and improve RegulonDB.
