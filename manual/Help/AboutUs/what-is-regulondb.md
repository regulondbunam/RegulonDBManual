# What is RegulonDB?

**RegulonDB** is a comprehensive and expertly curated knowledge base dedicated to the **transcriptional regulatory network of *Escherichia coli* K-12**, a model organism in molecular biology and systems biology. It has been developed and maintained by the *Computational Genomics Program* at the **Centro de Ciencias Gen√≥micas (UNAM)** for over two decades.

## Purpose and Mission

RegulonDB provides a **gold-standard reference** of experimentally supported regulatory elements in ***E. coli***, serving as a reliable resource for:

- Understanding the architecture of bacterial gene regulation
- Supporting the development and validation of computational models
- Enabling reproducible and interoperable analyses in genomics

Its **mission is to organize and disseminate high-quality regulatory knowledge** in a structured, computable format that meets the needs of both experimental and computational researchers.

<br>

## What It Contains

RegulonDB integrates detailed information on:

- **Genes, operons, and transcription units**, organized into functional transcriptional modules

- **Promoters and transcription start sites (TSSs)**, annotated with experimental evidence

- **Regulatory elements**, including transcription factors (TFs), small RNAs, their binding sites, and regulatory interactions

- **Transcription terminators**, supporting transcriptional boundaries

- **GENSOR Units (Genetic Sensory Response Units)**, which integrate environmental signals, regulatory proteins, and downstream gene expression responses to capture signal-to-function regulatory logic

Each item is annotated with specific **evidence codes**, capturing the method (e.g., EMSA, footprinting, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq) and strength of support (strong, weak, confirmed). Data are derived from peer-reviewed scientific literature and undergo manual curation by domain experts.

## Curation and Methodology

RegulonDB follows a robust, transparent data lifecycle that includes:

- Extraction of regulatory data from primary literature  
- Normalization and quality control of molecular entities  
- Annotation using **controlled vocabularies** and **biological ontologies**  
- Traceability to experimental conditions and original publications  

The database distinguishes between classical and high-throughput (HT) data, integrating HT results (e.g., TSSs, TFBSs from ChIP-seq) only when they meet criteria for functional relevance or cross-validation.

## Scientific and Technological Impact

With over **2,400 citations** in **more than 600 journals**, RegulonDB is a cornerstone in:

- Systems biology and network inference  
- Gene expression and promoter analysis  
- Machine learning and AI model validation  
- Synthetic biology and bioengineering  
- Comparative genomics and predictive modeling  

It is used globally by researchers in **microbiology**, **bioinformatics**, **computational biology**, **data science**, and **education**, and it plays a central role in validating tools, training models, and benchmarking pipelines.

## Access and Tools

RegulonDB provides:

- A user-friendly **web interface** with interactive visualizations  
- Advanced search and query tools  
- **Downloadable datasets** for both curated and HT data  
- **Integration with external databases** such as EcoCyc  
- Support for **APIs** and reproducible workflows  

The database is maintained with frequent updates and remains aligned with community standards.
